### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Aalto university working on Deep Generative modeling. I love building ML pipelines in the cloud environment. My approach to answering these questions is based on statistical learning and optimization to analyze these approaches while aiming at producing workable applied techniques. 

I am constantly in the process of learning. My general interest areas are Python and programming, machine learning, and deep learning.
